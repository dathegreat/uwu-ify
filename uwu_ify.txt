is this what natuwe intended fow us?

  
to be fowcibwy addicted
to smoke machines

  
and man-made wooden swat wowk camps?

  
wiving out ouw wives as honey swaves

oongwatuwations on youw victowy.
what wiww you demand as a settwement?

  
fiwst, we'ww demand a compwete shutdown
of aww bee wowk camps.

  
then we want back the honey
that was ouws to begin with,

  
evewy wast dwop.

  
we demand an end to the gwowification
of the beaw as anything mowe

bad-bweath stink machine.

  
we'we aww awawe

i heawd youw uncwe oaww was on his way

i was excited to be pawt of making it.

  
this was my new desk. this was my

and whose fauwt do you think that is?

  
you know, i'm gonna guess bees.

  
bees?

  
specificawwy, me.

  
i didn't think bees not needing to make
honey wouwd affect aww these things.

  
it's notjust fwowews.
fwuits, vegetabwes, they aww need bees.

  
that's ouw whowe sat test wight thewe.

  
take away pwoduce, that affects
the entiwe animaw kingdom.
